# JohnTitor (Yuki Okushi)

JohnTitor (Yuki Okushi) is a FLOSS nerd and time traveler.
Why time traveler? See [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor) for detail.

I live in Japan (UTC+9) but my timezone is frequently broken.

I'm currently working on a number of things related to Rust.

## Sponsoring

I currently have no job due to mental condition, so sponsoring is definitely helpful, thanks!
